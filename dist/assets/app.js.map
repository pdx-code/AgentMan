This is\n\t * different from generic pub-sub systems in two ways:\n\t *\n\t *   1) Callbacks are not subscribed to particular events. Every payload is\n\t *      dispatched to every registered callback.\n\t *   2) Callbacks can be deferred in whole or part until other callbacks have\n\t *      been executed.\n\t *\n\t * For example, consider this hypothetical flight destination form, which\n\t * selects a default city when a country is selected:\n\t *\n\t *   var flightDispatcher = new Dispatcher();\n\t *\n\t *   // Keeps track of which country is selected\n\t *   var CountryStore = {country: null};\n\t *\n\t *   // Keeps track of which city is selected\n\t *   var CityStore = {city: null};\n\t *\n\t *   // Keeps track of the base flight price of the selected city\n\t *   var FlightPriceStore = {price: null}\n\t *\n\t * When a user changes the selected city, we dispatch the payload:\n\t *\n\t *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n\t *     actionType: 'city-update',\n\t *     selectedCity: 'paris'\n\t *   });\n\t *\n\t * This payload is digested by `CityStore`:\n\t *\n\t *   flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n\t *     if (payload.actionType === 'city-update') {\n\t *       CityStore.city = payload.selectedCity;\n\t *     }\n\t *   });\n\t *\n\t * When the user selects a country, we dispatch the payload:\n\t *\n\t *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n\t *     actionType: 'country-update',\n\t *     selectedCountry: 'australia'\n\t *   });\n\t *\n\t * This payload is digested by both stores:\n\t *\n\t *   CountryStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n\t *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n\t *       CountryStore.country = payload.selectedCountry;\n\t *     }\n\t *   });\n\t *\n\t * When the callback to update `CountryStore` is registered, we save a reference\n\t * to the returned token. Using this token with `waitFor()`, we can guarantee\n\t * that `CountryStore` is updated before the callback that updates `CityStore`\n\t * needs to query its data.\n\t *\n\t *   CityStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n\t *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n\t *       // `CountryStore.country` may not be updated.\n\t *       flightDispatcher.waitFor([CountryStore.dispatchToken]);\n\t *       // `CountryStore.country` is now guaranteed to be updated.\n\t *\n\t *       // Select the default city for the new country\n\t *       CityStore.city = getDefaultCityForCountry(CountryStore.country);\n\t *     }\n\t *   });\n\t *\n\t * The usage of `waitFor()` can be chained, for example:\n\t *\n\t *   FlightPriceStore.dispatchToken =\n\t *     flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n\t *       switch (payload.actionType) {\n\t *         case 'country-update':\n\t *         case 'city-update':\n\t *           flightDispatcher.waitFor([CityStore.dispatchToken]);\n\t *           FlightPriceStore.price =\n\t *             getFlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);\n\t *           break;\n\t *     }\n\t *   });\n\t *\n\t * The `country-update` payload will be guaranteed to invoke the stores'\n\t * registered callbacks in order: `CountryStore`, `CityStore`, then\n\t * `FlightPriceStore`.\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar Dispatcher = (function () {\n\t  function Dispatcher() {\n\t    _classCallCheck(this, Dispatcher);\n\t\n\t    this._callbacks = {};\n\t    this._isDispatching = false;\n\t    this._isHandled = {};\n\t    this._isPending = {};\n\t    this._lastID = 1;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t   * Registers a callback to be invoked with every dispatched payload.

This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .

Every payload is\n *      dispatched to every registered callback.\n *   2) Callbacks can be deferred in whole or part until other callbacks have\n *      been executed.\n *\n * For example, consider this hypothetical flight destination form, which\n * selects a default city when a country is selected:\n *\n *   var flightDispatcher = new Dispatcher();\n *\n *   // Keeps track of which country is selected\n *   var CountryStore = {country: null};\n *\n *   // Keeps track of which city is selected\n *   var CityStore = {city: null};\n *\n *   // Keeps track of the base flight price of the selected city\n *   var FlightPriceStore = {price: null}\n *\n * When a user changes the selected city, we dispatch the payload:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n *     actionType: 'city-update',\n *     selectedCity: 'paris'\n *   });\n *\n * This payload is digested by `CityStore`:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'city-update') {\n *       CityStore.city = payload.selectedCity;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * When the user selects a country, we dispatch the payload:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n *     actionType: 'country-update',\n *     selectedCountry: 'australia'\n *   });\n *\n * This payload is digested by both stores:\n *\n *   CountryStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n *       CountryStore.country = payload.selectedCountry;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * When the callback to update `CountryStore` is registered, we save a reference\n * to the returned token. Using this token with `waitFor()`, we can guarantee\n * that `CountryStore` is updated before the callback that updates `CityStore`\n * needs to query its data.\n *\n *   CityStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n *       // `CountryStore.country` may not be updated.\n *       flightDispatcher.waitFor([CountryStore.dispatchToken]);\n *       // `CountryStore.country` is now guaranteed to be updated.\n *\n *       // Select the default city for the new country\n *       CityStore.city = getDefaultCityForCountry(CountryStore.country);\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * The usage of `waitFor()` can be chained, for example:\n *\n *   FlightPriceStore.dispatchToken =\n *     flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *       switch (payload.actionType) {\n *         case 'country-update':\n *         case 'city-update':\n *           flightDispatcher.waitFor([CityStore.dispatchToken]);\n *           FlightPriceStore.price =\n *             getFlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);\n *           break;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * The `country-update` payload will be guaranteed to invoke the stores'\n * registered callbacks in order: `CountryStore`, `CityStore`, then\n * `FlightPriceStore`.\n */\n\nvar Dispatcher = (function () {\n  function Dispatcher() {\n    _classCallCheck(this, Dispatcher);\n\n    this._callbacks = {};\n    this._isDispatching = false;\n    this._isHandled = {};\n    this._isPending = {};\n    this._lastID = 1;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Registers a callback to be invoked with every dispatched payload.
